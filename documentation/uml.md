# UML Diagrams

This section will contain various UML diagrams illustrating the system's architecture, behavior, and structure. Examples include:

*   **Use Case Diagrams:** To show the different ways users interact with the system.
*   **Class Diagrams:** To represent the static structure of the system, including classes, their attributes, operations, and relationships.
*   **Sequence Diagrams:** To depict the interactions between objects in a time-ordered sequence.
*   **Activity Diagrams:** To illustrate the flow of control or data within the system.

For the PlantUML source, refer to [`uml.puml`](uml.puml).
